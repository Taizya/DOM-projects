# DOM-projects
This project is a collection of projects for learning purposes. The goal of this project is to learn and understand the use off javascript in front end development. The original idea came from this [article](https://dev.to/jisan/20-dom-projects-your-frontend-breakthrough-1h8a). My challenge for this might not be to do all 20 but do do atleast 5 of the projects.

If you got any sort of value from this project You're welcome I guess.
